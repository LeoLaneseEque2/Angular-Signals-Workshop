ðŸŸ© State isn't just data. It's behaviour waiting to happen.

> Workshop Title: Evolving Angular: Imperative â†’ Reactive â†’ Signals. The New Angular Mindset

## Why This Matters: 
ðŸ”¸ Signals in Templates: Less Boilerplate
ðŸ”¸ Performance boost: 
ðŸ”¸ Fine-grained updates: Changes bypass the component tree, updating only the specific computeds and effects that depend on the changed signal. This is often more efficient than a Virtual DOM diff
ðŸ”¸ Smarter Change Detection: Updating Only What's Needed
ðŸ”¸ Signal can work with ZoneJS (zoneless)
ðŸ”¸ Angular best-practices Prefer Signals, Over BehaviorSubjects for State Management

## So, why again?
Less code + fewer bugs + faster Apps = Happier Devs!

ðŸŸ© Angular Signals Change the Way We Build Angular Apps

## Angular progression as days going by:
â†’ Angular 2â€“12 days: Imperative, manual subscribe/unsubscribe, ZoneJS 
â†’ Angular 12â€“16 days: Reactive & declarative with RxJS + async pipes (streams mostly "pull data -> display") 
â†’ Angular 16+ days: Modern declarative hybrid + Signals and reactive state 

## If you zoom out:
```js
Zones â†’ RxJS + async pipe â†’ Signals + fine-grained reactivity + ZoneLess
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

â†’ Typical Angular 2â€“12: Imperative, manual subscribe/unsubscribe 

We're already working with Observables and streams, but the way most Devs used it wasn't really reactive in the "declarative" sense,
it was imperative plumbing around a reactive library.
```js
// Typical pattern Angular 2â€“11 days
// WIGON: Imperative use of a reactive library
// RxJS used imperatively â€” you manage subscription lifecycle yourself
ngOnInit() {
  this.sub = this.service.getData().subscribe(res => {
    this.data = res;
  });
}

ngOnDestroy() {
  this.sub.unsubscribe();
}
```


â†’ Typical Angular 12â€“16 days: Declarative template binding (async pipe) 

async pipe does the subscribing/unsubscribing automatically in the template

```js
{{ (service.getData() | async)?.name }}
```


â†’ Typical pattern Angular 16+ days: Signals wrap observables, template reacts automatically to data. Template just reacts to data

```js
data = toSignal(this.service.getData());
```

ðŸŸ© Understanding Signals

ðŸ¤” What Are Signals?
> Signals are reactive primitives containers, that hold an immutable single value. When that value changes, they automatically trigger change detection. Unlike Observables, which emit over time.

ðŸš¨ Signals are immutable containers, but if the value they hold is a reference (like an object or array), that reference can be mutated directly, which bypasses Angular reactivity system.
ðŸš¨ Signals hold an immutable value, but the signal reference itself is mutable, that why we can change the value of a signal because objects and arrays are passed by reference in JS

ðŸ¤” Observables
> Are a `lazy`, `push`, `collection` of `multple values`

- `lazy` Need to subscribe to it
- `push` Obs$ push values to consumer
- `collection` because are collections of data similar to Arrays
- `multiple values` because Observables can produce 0, or many values over time. Instantly, slowly or never


ðŸ¤” Real Analogy
Think of Observables like a water pipe: once you connect (subscribe), you start getting the flow. 

Instead, Signals are more like a glass of water, always present, always filled with the latest value. When the value changes, it's like someone replaced the water, and everything watching it gets notified instantly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸŸ© Angular Change-Detection & Signals

Angular is transitioning to fine-grained reactivity. Because with default change detection, there is no way for Angular to know exactly what has changed on the page, so that is why we cannot make any "assumptions" about what happened, and we need to check everything.

> Signals are all about enabling very fine-grained updates to the DOM that are just not possible with the current change detection systems that we have available.

ðŸŸ© Signal common Patterns

- signal-input-pattern architecture
- Derived State: 
Use computed/createMemo for expensive calculations or values that depend on other signals.

```js
const isEven = createMemo(() => count() % 2 === 0);
```

Batch Updates: 
```js
Group multiple signal updates to trigger only one re-calculation.
batch(() => {
  setFirstName("John");
  setLastName("Doe");
}); // Effect depending on name runs only once.
```

Converting Observables <-> Signals:

ðŸŸ© Best Practices & Quick Notes

ðŸ”¸Use signals for local, synchronous state in components.
ðŸ”¸Use observables for async streams (HTTP, websockets, timers).
ðŸ”¸Combine both: toSignal() to consume observables easily in templates.
ðŸ”¸Replace many @Input() + ngOnChanges() patterns with signals + computed values.
ðŸ”¸Signals don't replace Observables
ðŸ”¸Signals don't replace Observables; they are state containers that allow you to store and react to values in a reactive way.
ðŸ”¸Angular favour signal() / computed() / effect() for component-local or simple service state; reserve BehaviorSubject / Observables for event streams (HTTP, websockets, router events, etc)

Angular Reactive Forms with Signals (Angular 17+) and Signal-Based Forms (Angular 21+):
Angular traditionally offers template-driven and reactive forms. Template-driven forms use ngModel bindings and directives (e.g. NgForm, NgModel) in the template. Reactive forms (via @angular/forms) use FormControl and FormGroup classes to manage form state explicitly. Now, Angular also introduce Signals, a fine-grained reactivity model reducing boilerplate and improving reactivity.
